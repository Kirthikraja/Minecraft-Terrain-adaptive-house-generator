# Minecraft Terrain-Adaptive Villa Generator

This project is an extension of the [GDPC (Generative Design Python Client)](https://github.com/avdstaaij/gdpc) that builds a terrain-aware, fully decorated villa compound in Minecraft. It automatically scans the world slice, selects a stable location, and procedurally constructs a multi-room house, compound walls, decorative pathways, a garden, and even a swimming poolâ€”emphasizing architectural variety and livability.

## Getting Started

Run the following to initiate the villa generation:

```bash
python main.py
